# HAVE_GLIBC_STRERROR_R
#    indicates whether the executable would have been able to run on its
#    target platform. If so, set HAVE_GLIBC_STRERROR_R to
#    the exit code (in many cases 0 for success), otherwise enter "FAILED_TO_RUN".
# HAVE_GLIBC_STRERROR_R__TRYRUN_OUTPUT
#    contains the text the executable would have printed on stdout and stderr.
#    If the executable would not have been able to run, set HAVE_GLIBC_STRERROR_R__TRYRUN_OUTPUT empty.
#    Otherwise check if the output is evaluated by the calling CMake code. If so,
#    check what the source file would have printed when called with the given arguments.
# The HAVE_GLIBC_STRERROR_R_COMPILE variable holds the build result for this TRY_RUN().
